overview: 'Lowe''s exposes 3 API operations that an AI agent could call, of which 0 are state-changing ''acting'' operations.

  By consequence: 3 read.


  Contracts are classified heuristically from the provider''s OpenAPI and refresh on every APIs.io network build; audience is bound per deployment. The model follows Curity''s Access Intelligence (apidays Munich 2026). Browse every provider''s agent contracts at [agentic-access.apis.io](https://apis.io/agentic-access/).'
