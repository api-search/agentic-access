overview: 'iContainers exposes 15 API operations that an AI agent could call, of which 7 are state-changing ''acting'' operations. This is a recommended x-agentic-access execution contract — the scope, audience, consequence tier, short-lived token constraints, and escalation each action should carry before it is handed to an autonomous agent.


  By consequence: 8 read and 7 write.


  Contracts are classified heuristically from the provider''s OpenAPI and refresh on every APIs.io network build; audience is bound per deployment. The model follows Curity''s Access Intelligence (apidays Munich 2026). Browse every provider''s agent contracts at [agentic-access.apis.io](https://apis.io/agentic-access/).'
